# Auto Player Stats

THIS APPLICATION IS NO LONGER RELEVENT OR SUPPORTED. USE https://github.com/EthanHarv/HypixelStats INSTEAD.

Very janky, just something I threw together in a 6 hour marathon for fun.

Updates coming to make MUCH more dynamic - selectable endpoints (for different gamemodes) and layouts!

Also plan to add auto-detection of player join and player leave to update list more dynamically instead of the one-shot /who process I've got going on right now.

(also possibly send a /who automatically - plenty of TODO's!)
