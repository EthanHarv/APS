# Auto Player Stats

Very janky, just something I threw together in a 6 hour marathon for fun.

Updates coming to make MUCH more dynamic - selectable endpoints (for different gamemodes) and layouts!

Also plan to add auto-detection of playerjoin and playerleave to update list more dynamically instead of the one-shot /who process I've got going on right now.

(also possibly send a /who automatically - plenty of TODO's!)
